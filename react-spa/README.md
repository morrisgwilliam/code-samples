This project is using a vite + React template.

A simple React SPA to look into how many first round and second round players there are for a given NBA team. This data is important as it shows how the team has been performing with their player picks in the NBA draft. So, we are looking for a consolidated data to see how many players are from round 1 and round 2.

You can use https://www.balldontlie.io/#getting-started to find the documentation on the API you will need to use to successfully produce the results. You can sign up for the API Key with free tier. You should be able to run everything with the free version.
